Reflection

Our group created a site that allows users to look at the nation's taxt data in an easy and aesthetic way.
We worked well together setting specific deadlines and expectations so
we are all on the same page. I worked on creating the table with all the specific
information we needed from each state in regards to spending in specific areas like welfare,
transportation, education, military, and health. Then I
worked on the front end of the map and styled it with the css alongside my group member. Dâ€™Aundre
worked on the second page of the website with the spending breakdown for each state.
Lastly, I worked on the About Us page explaining what each category means and
why they are so important. We worked very well, each person put in a lot of effort and time. The
work was divided equally among everyone, the end result is a project I am proud of.
